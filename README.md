UNP-project_SQL-with-SQL-Maven_Market

Completed this Project as a Part of my Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

This SQL project involves querying a database, likely from a retail or sales context, to extract valuable insights. The queries cover a range of analyses, including total revenue by category and region, average order value, daily sales trends, product profitability, customer count, and territory-wise sales. 

Key Highlights:
Later,the project was divided in 3 steps

Step :- 1 Creating Maven Market database:- Created the "Maven_Market" database, which included tables for Customers, Products, Regions, Returns, Stores, and Transactions.

Step :- 2 Transfering the Data from Backup file to Maven Market database:- Backed up the database as "Maven_Market_Backup" and performed date column transformations for consistency. The modified data was then transfered into the original database.

Step :- 3 Solving Queries:- Calculating costs, sales figures, and revenue.Analyzing customer demographics and product performance.Segmenting revenue and sales data by region, income, and membership.
